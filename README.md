# Foundry.coffee
## A modular-esque framework for Coffee-Script developers? I dunno...
It introduces some classes such as Module, Widget, etc.
May end up having some sort of UI component too?

This is really just a place for me to keep my code but you're welcome to expand on it or help contribute to making it better!

Everything will extend "Module" due to my incesent need to be able to "mixin" separate AMD modules into a single class.  Just like to have my code in separate files but still allow for the single class to contain everything.

You can copy the "lib" or just use the compiled source, but either way, your usage remains.
I prefer the lib so you can quickly edit alter the foundry framework if you please within the familiar coffee syntax.
