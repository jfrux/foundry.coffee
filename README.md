# Foundry.coffee
## A modular-esque framework for Coffee-Script developers? I dunno...
It introduces some classes such as Module, Widget, etc.
May end up having some sort of UI component too?

This is really just a place for me to keep my code but you're welcome to expand on it or help contribute to making it better!
